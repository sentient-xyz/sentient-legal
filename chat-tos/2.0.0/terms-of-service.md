    1.  **Investigations.** Sentient reserves the right, but is not obligated, to monitor or review the Service and Content at any time. Without limiting the foregoing, Sentient shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to remove any of Your Content for any reason (or no reason), including if such Content violates the Agreement or any applicable law. Although Sentient does not generally monitor user activity occurring in connection with the Service or Content, if Sentient becomes aware of any possible violations by you of any provision of the Agreement, Sentient reserves the right to investigate such violations, and Sentient may, at its sole discretion, immediately terminate your license to use the Service, or change, alter or remove Your Content, in whole or in part, without prior notice to you. If Sentient believes that criminal activity has occurred, Sentient reserves the right to, except to the extent prohibited by applicable law, disclose any information or materials on or in the Service, including Your Content, in Sentientʼs possession in connection with your use of the Service, to (i) comply with applicable laws, legal process or governmental request, (ii) enforce this Agreement, (iii) respond to any claims that Your Content violates the rights of third parties, (iv) respond to your requests for customer service, or (v) protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Sentient, its users or the public, and all enforcement or other government officials, as Sentient in its sole discretion believes to be necessary or appropriate.

7.  **THIRD-PARTY SERVICES.**

    1.  **Third-Party Services.** The Service may use, rely on, and/or contain links to third-party websites, applications, services (including without limitation AI Services), and ads, (collectively, the **“Third-Party Servicesˮ**). Such Third-Party Services are not under the control of Sentient. Sentient is not responsible for any Third-Party Services. When you use any Third-Party Services, you become subject to the terms and conditions (including privacy policies) of another website or destination. Sentient does not review, approve, monitor, endorse, warrant, or make any representations with respect to Third-Party Services, or any product or service provided in connection therewith. You use all links in Third-Party Services at your own risk. When you leave our Service, this Agreement and our policies no longer govern. You should review applicable terms and policies, including privacy and data gathering practices, of any Third-Party Services, and make whatever investigation you feel necessary or appropriate before proceeding with any transaction with any third party.

## Sharing Your Content and Information Through Third-Party Services. Sentient may provide tools through the Service that enable you to export information, including Your Content, to Third-Party Services, including through features that allow you to link your Account with a Linked App account. By using one of these tools, you agree that Sentient may transfer that information to the applicable Third-Party Services. Sentient is not responsible for any Third-Party Serviceʼs use of your exported information, nor for any use by you of any information (including without limitation Output) shared by you with or through any Linked App or other Third-Party Services.

8.  **FEES AND PURCHASE TERMS.**

    1.  **Fees**. You shall pay all fees or charges (“**Fees**ˮ) to your Account in accordance with the fees, charges and billing terms in effect at the time a Fee is due and payable. Any Fees will be set forth on the Service at the time of the applicable transaction.

    2.  **Gas Fees**. To the extent applicable in connection with a particular Service, you will be solely responsible for ensuring that you have sufficient User Assets in your Wallet to cover any Gas Fee required to complete any transaction or effect any other use of the Service. “**Gas Fees**ˮ are transaction fees determined by market conditions on the applicable protocol, and are not determined, set, or charged by Sentient.

    3.  **Taxes**. You are responsible for all federal, state, local, sales, use, value added, excise, or other taxes, fees, or duties arising out of the Agreement or the transactions contemplated by the Agreement (other than taxes based on Sentientʼs net income). You are solely responsible (and Sentient has no responsibility) for determining what, if any, taxes apply to any transactions involving your User Assets.

    4.  **Currency**. You may not substitute any other currency, whether cryptocurrency or fiat currency, for the currency in which you have contracted to pay any Fees. For clarity, no fluctuation in the value of any currency, whether cryptocurrency or otherwise, will impact or excuse your obligations with respect to any purchase.

    5.  **Payment Service Provider**. Sentient may use one or more third-party service providers for payment services (e.g., card acceptance, cryptocurrency payments, merchant settlement, and related services) (each, a “**Payment Service Provider**ˮ). Please note that online payment transactions may be subject to validation checks by our Payment Service Provider and your card issuer, and we are not responsible if your card issuer declines to authorize payment for any reason. For your protection, our Payment Service Provider uses various fraud prevention protocols and industry standard verification systems to reduce fraud, and you authorize it to verify and authenticate your payment information. Your card issuer may charge you an online handling fee or processing fee. We are not responsible for this. In some jurisdictions, our Payment Service Provider may use third parties under strict confidentiality and data protection requirements for the purposes of payment processing services. We may add or change Payment Service Providers at any time in our sole discretion.

    6.  **Payment**. By providing Sentient and/or our Payment Service Provider with your payment information, you agree that Sentient and/or our Payment Service Provider is authorized to immediately invoice your Account for all Fees due and payable to Sentient hereunder and that no additional notice or consent is required. You shall immediately notify Sentient and/or our Payment Service Provider of any change in your payment information to maintain its completeness and accuracy. Sentient reserves the right at any time to change its prices and billing methods in its sole discretion. You agree to have sufficient funds or credit available upon placement of any order to ensure that the purchase price is collectible by us. Your failure to provide accurate payment information to Sentient and/or our Payment Service Provider, as applicable, or our inability to collect payment constitutes your material breach of this Agreement. Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, all Fees for the Service are non-refundable.

9.  **Indemnification.** You shall indemnify and hold Sentient, its parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, employees, agents, partners, suppliers, and licensors (each, a **“Sentient Partyˮ** and collectively, the **“Sentient Partiesˮ**) harmless from any losses, costs, liabilities and expenses (including reasonable attorneysʼ fees) relating to or arising out of any and all of the following: (1)Your Content, including any Input provided by you or use of the Output by you or any third party;(2) your use of, or inability to use, the Service; (3) your violation of this Agreement; (4) your violation of any rights of another party, including your use of any Input that infringes a third partyʼs proprietary rights; (5) misuse of AI models, or reliance on AI-generated models or (6) your violation of any applicable laws, rules or regulations. Sentient reserves the right, at its own cost, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you, in which event you will fully cooperate with Sentient in asserting any available defenses. This provision does not require you to indemnify any of the Sentient Parties for any unconscionable commercial practice by such party or for such partyʼs fraud, deception, false promise, misrepresentation or concealment, or suppression or omission of any material fact in connection with the Service provided hereunder. You agree that the provisions in this Section will survive any termination of your Account, this Agreement and/or your access to the Service.

10. **ASSUMPTION OF RISK RELATED TO BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY.** In order to be successfully completed, any transaction initiated by or sent to your Wallet must be confirmed by and recorded on the applicable network, blockchain, or protocol. Sentient has no control over any blockchain and therefore cannot and does not ensure that any transaction details that you submit or receive via the Service will be validated by or confirmed on the relevant network and does not have the ability to facilitate any cancellation or modification requests. You accept and acknowledge that you take full responsibility for all activities that you effect through your Wallet and accept all risks of loss, including loss as a result of any authorized or unauthorized access to your Wallet, to the maximum extent permitted by law. You further accept and acknowledge that:

    1.  Sentientʼs token serves as a utility within the Platform, providing access to AI services, governance, and rewards for contributors. It does not represent an investment contract, and users should not expect financial returns from holding or using Sentient tokens. Sentient makes no representations regarding token value or tradability.

    2.  Token holders participating in governance acknowledge that decisions are made through decentralized voting mechanisms. Sentient is not responsible for governance decisions made by token holders or resulting platform changes

    3.  You (i) have the necessary technical expertise and ability to review and evaluate the security, integrity and operation of your Wallet; (ii) have the knowledge, experience, understanding, professional advice and information to make your own evaluation of the merits, risks and applicable compliance requirements under applicable laws of any use of your Wallet; (iii) know, understand and accept the risks associated with your Wallet; and (iv) accept the risks associated with blockchain technology generally, and are responsible for conducting your own independent analysis of the risks specific to any Digital Assets you purchase or sell. You further agree that Sentient will have no responsibility or liability for, such risks.

    4.  The prices of Digital Assets can be extremely volatile. Sentient makes no warranties as to the markets in which Digital Assets are transferred, purchased, or traded.

    5.  You are solely responsible for determining what, if any, taxes apply to your transactions of Digital Assets. Sentient is not responsible for determining the taxes that apply to Digital Asset transactions.

    6.  Sentient does not store, send, or receive Digital Assets. This is because Digital Assets exist only by virtue of the ownership record maintained on its supporting blockchain, and so any transfer of Digital Assets occurs within the supporting blockchain and not in the Service. The transaction details you submit via the Service may not be completed, or may be substantially delayed, as a result of activity or lack thereof on the blockchain used to process the transaction. Once transaction details have been submitted through your Wallet, Sentient cannot assist you to cancel or otherwise modify your transaction or transaction details. Sentient makes no warranties or guarantees that a transfer initiated on the Service will successfully transfer title or right in any Digital Asset.

    7.  There are risks associated with using an Internet based currency, including but not limited to, the risk of hardware, software and Internet connections; the risk of malicious software introduction; the risk that third parties may obtain unauthorized access to information stored within your Wallet; and the risk of counterfeit assets, mislabeled assets, assets that are vulnerable to metadata decay, assets on smart contracts with bugs, and assets that may become untransferable. You accept and acknowledge that Sentient will not be responsible for any communication failures, disruptions, errors, distortions or delays or losses you may experience when using blockchain technology, however caused.

    8.  The regulatory regime governing blockchain technologies, cryptocurrencies, and tokens is uncertain, and new regulations or policies may materially adversely affect the development of the Service and the utility of Digital Assets.

    9.  Sentient makes no guarantee as to the functionality of any blockchainʼs decentralized governance, which could, among other things, lead to delays, conflicts of interest, or operational decisions that are unfavorable to certain owners of certain Digital Assets. You acknowledge and accept that the protocols governing the operation of a blockchain may be subject to sudden changes in operating rules which may materially alter the blockchain and affect the value and function of Digital Assets supported by that blockchain.

    10. Sentient makes no guarantee as to the security of any blockchain. Sentient is not liable for any hacks, double spending, stolen Digital Assets, or any other attacks on a blockchain.

    11. The Service relies on, and Sentient makes no guarantee or warranties as to the functionality of or access to, any third-party Wallet (such as Privy).

The provisions of this section 11(a) apply with full force to such features or tools.

2.  **No Liability for Conduct of Third Parties.** YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL OF YOUR COMMUNICATIONS AND INTERACTIONS WITH THIRD PARTIES ON THE SERVICE. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT THE SENTIENT PARTIES ARE NOT LIABLE, AND YOU AGREE NOT TO SEEK TO HOLD THE SENTIENT PARTIES LIABLE, FOR THE CONDUCT OF THIRD PARTIES, INCLUDING OPERATORS OF EXTERNAL SITES, ANY THIRD-PARTY PROVIDERS OF AI SERVICES, AND OPERATORS OF EXTERNAL SITES AND PROVIDERS OF USER ASSET INFORMATION, AND THAT THE RISK OF INJURY FROM SUCH THIRD PARTIES RESTS ENTIRELY WITH YOU. SENTIENT MAKES NO WARRANTY THAT THE SERVICES PROVIDED BY THIRD PARTIES INCLUDING AI SERVICES WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS OR BE AVAILABLE ON AN UNINTERRUPTED, SECURE, OR ERROR-FREE BASIS. SENTIENT MAKES NO WARRANTY REGARDING THE QUALITY OF ANY SUCH SERVICE, OR THE ACCURACY, TIMELINESS, TRUTHFULNESS, COMPLETENESS OR RELIABILITY OF ANY USER CONTENT OBTAINED THROUGH THE SERVICE.

YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ENSURING THAT YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE AND ANY OUTPUT COMPLIES WITH ALL APPLICABLE LAWS.**

NEITHER SENTIENT NOR ITS SUPPLIERS OR LICENSORS SHALL BE CONSIDERED AN “EXPERTˮ UNDER THE APPLICABLE SECURITIES LEGISLATION IN YOUR JURISDICTION. NEITHER SENTIENT NOR ITS SUPPLIERS OR LICENSORS WARRANT THAT THE SERVICE COMPLIES WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF ANY APPLICABLE REGULATORY AUTHORITY, SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION, OR ANY SIMILAR ORGANIZATION OR REGULATOR OR WITH THE SECURITIES LAWS OF ANY JURISDICTION. YOU SHOULD CONSULT A LICENSED PROFESSIONAL BEFORE TAKING ANY ACTION IN RELIANCE ON ANY OUTPUT FROM ANY APP. **THE SERVICE IS FOR ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES ONLY AND SENTIENT DOES NOT PROVIDE ANY FINANCIAL OR INVESTMENT ADVICE OR RECOMMENDATIONS, WITH RESPECT TO ANY DIGITAL ASSETS OR OTHERWISE.**

&nbsp;

12. **LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.**

    1.  **Disclaimer of Certain Damages.** YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PROVIDED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL THE SENTIENT PARTIES BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE OR DATA, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR DAMAGES OR COSTS DUE TO LOSS OF PRODUCTION OR USE, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, OR PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE SERVICES, IN EACH CASE WHETHER OR NOT ANY SENTIENT PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, THE SERVICE, OR ANY COMMUNICATIONS, INTERACTIONS OR MEETINGS WITH OTHER USERS OF THE SERVICE OR THIRD PARTIES, ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, INCLUDING TO THE EXTENT RESULTING FROM: (a) THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICE; (b) ANY DATA, INFORMATION OR SERVICE PURCHASED OR OBTAINED; OR MESSAGES RECEIVED FOR TRANSACTIONS ENTERED INTO THROUGH THE SERVICE; (c) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO OR ALTERATION OF YOUR TRANSMISSIONS OR DATA; (d) STATEMENTS OR CONDUCT OF ANY THIRD PARTY ON THE SERVICE; OR (e) ANY OTHER MATTER RELATED TO THE SERVICE, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, COPYRIGHT, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE, PRODUCT LIABILITY OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY.

    3.  **User Content.** SENTIENT ASSUMES NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE TIMELINESS, DELETION, MISDELIVERY OR FAILURE TO STORE ANY CONTENT INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, YOUR CONTENT AND USER CONTENT, USER COMMUNICATIONS OR PERSONALIZATION SETTINGS.

    4.  **Exclusion of Damages.** CERTAIN JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF CERTAIN DAMAGES. IF THESE LAWS APPLY TO YOU, SOME OR ALL OF THE ABOVE EXCLUSIONS OR LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU, AND YOU MIGHT HAVE ADDITIONAL RIGHTS.

    5.  **Basis of the Bargain.** THE LIMITATIONS OF DAMAGES SET FORTH ABOVE ARE FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN SENTIENT AND YOU.

    6.  **Non-Reliance.** All claims, content, designs, algorithms, estimates, roadmaps, specifications, and performance measurements with respect to or otherwise described in the Service are done in the good faith efforts of Sentient and its affiliates. It is up to you to check and validate their accuracy and truthfulness. Furthermore, nothing in the Service constitutes a solicitation for investment. Any such Content produced by Sentient has not been subject to audit. Sentient does not encourage, induce, or sanction the deployment, integration, or use of the Service in violation of applicable laws or regulations and hereby prohibits any such deployment, integration or use. This includes use of any such applications by you (a) in violation of export control or sanctions laws of the United States or any other applicable jurisdiction, (b) if you are located in or ordinarily resident in a country or territory subject to comprehensive sanctions administered by OFAC, or (c) if you are or are working on behalf of a Specially Designated National (“**SDN**ˮ) or a person subject to similar blocking or denied party prohibitions.

13. **TERM AND TERMINATION.**

    1.  **Term.** The term of this Agreement commences on the date when you accept this Agreement (as described in the preamble above) and continues in full force and effect while you use the Service, unless terminated earlier in accordance with this Agreement.

    2.  **Prior Use**. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you hereby acknowledge and agree that the Agreement commenced on the earlier to occur of (a) the date you first used the Service, or (b) the date you accepted the Agreement, and will remain in full force and effect while you use any Service, unless earlier terminated in accordance with the Agreement.

    3.  **Termination of Service by Sentient.** Sentient is free to terminate (or suspend access to) your use of the Service for any reason in our discretion, including your breach of this Agreement subject to applicable law. Sentient has the sole right to decide whether you are in violation of any of the restrictions set forth in this Agreement. If we suspend your use of the Service, you may continue to access your Wallet directly or through other services not hosted by us. Sentient will not have any liability whatsoever to you for any suspension or termination. Users agree that Sentient is not liable for loss of access to AI models or tokens resulting from account termination.

    4.  **Termination by You.** If you want to terminate the Service provided by Sentient, you may do so by ceasing your use of the Service. You may continue to access your Wallet directly or through other services not hosted by us.

    5.  **Effect of Termination.** Upon termination of the Service or the applicable feature or functionality thereof, your right to use the Service or the applicable feature or functionality thereof will automatically terminate, and we reserve the right (but have no obligation) to delete any Content associated with your Account. If we terminate your Account for cause, we may also bar your further use or access to the Service. Sentient will not have any liability whatsoever to you for any suspension or termination, including for deletion of Your Content. All provisions of this Agreement which by their nature should survive, will survive termination of Service, including without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, and limitations of liability.

    6.  **No Subsequent Registration.** If this Agreement is terminated for cause by Sentient or if your Account or ability to access the Service is discontinued by Sentient due to your violation of any portion of this Agreement or for conduct otherwise deemed inappropriate, then you agree that you shall not attempt to re-register with or access the Service through use of a different member name or otherwise.

14. **INTERNATIONAL USERS.** The Service may be accessed from countries around the world and may contain references to services and Content that are not available in your country. These references do not imply that Sentient intends to provide such service or Content in your country. The Service is controlled and offered by Sentient Labs Pte. Ltd. located in Singapore and from its facilities in the United States of America. Sentient makes no representations that the Service is appropriate or available for use in other locations. Those who access or use the Service from other countries do so at their own volition and are responsible for compliance with local law.

15. **ARBITRATION AGREEMENT. Please read this Section (the “Arbitration Agreementˮ) carefully. It is part of your contract with Sentient and affects your rights. It contains procedures for MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION AND A CLASS ACTION WAIVER.**

    1.  **Applicability of Arbitration Agreement.** Subject to the terms of this Arbitration Agreement, you and Sentient agree that any dispute, claim, disagreements arising out of or relating in any way to your access to or use of any Service (including the Website and/or the Apps), any communications you receive, any products sold or distributed through the Service or this Agreement and prior versions of this Agreement, including claims and disputes that arose between you and us before the effective date of this Agreement (each, a **“Disputeˮ**) will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that: (a) you and Sentient may assert claims or seek relief in small claims court if such claims qualify and remain in small claims court; and (b) you or Sentient may seek equitable relief in court for infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, and patents). For purposes of this Arbitration Agreement, “Disputeˮ will also include disputes that arose or involve facts occurring before the existence of this or any prior versions of this Agreement as well as claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement. This Arbitration Agreement does not apply to claims involving alleged violations of regulatory compliance matters, or any claim where injunctive relief is sought by a government entity.

    2.  **Informal Dispute Resolution.** There might be instances when a Dispute arises between you and Sentient. If that occurs, Sentient is committed to working with you to reach a reasonable resolution. You and Sentient agree that good faith informal efforts to resolve Disputes can result in a prompt, low‐cost and mutually beneficial outcome (**“Informal Dispute Resolutionˮ**). You and Sentient therefore agree that before either party commences arbitration against the other (or initiates an action in small claims court if a party so elects), we will personally meet and confer telephonically or via videoconference, in a good faith effort to resolve informally any Dispute covered by this Arbitration Agreement (**“Informal Dispute Resolution Conferenceˮ**). If you are represented by counsel, your counsel may participate in the conference, but you will also participate in the conference.

    &nbsp;

    1.  The party initiating a Dispute must give notice to the other party in writing of its intent to initiate an Informal Dispute Resolution Conference (**“Noticeˮ**), which shall occur within forty-five 45 days after the other party receives such Notice, unless an extension is mutually agreed upon by the parties. Notice to Sentient that you intend to initiate an Informal Dispute Resolution Conference should be sent by email to [contact@sentient.xyz.](mailto:contact@sentient.xyz) The Notice must include: 1 your name, telephone number, mailing address, e‐mail address associated with your Account (if you have one); (2) the name, telephone number, mailing address and e‐mail address of your counsel, if any; and 3 a description of your Dispute.

    2.  The Informal Dispute Resolution Conference shall be individualized such that a separate conference must be held each time either party initiates a Dispute, even if the same law firm or group of law firms represents multiple users in similar cases, unless all parties agree; multiple individuals initiating a Dispute cannot participate in the same Informal Dispute Resolution Conference unless all parties agree. In the time between a party receiving the Notice and the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference, nothing in this Arbitration Agreement shall prohibit the parties from engaging in informal communications to resolve the initiating partyʼs Dispute. Engaging in the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference is a condition precedent and requirement that must be fulfilled before commencing arbitration. The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference process required by this Section.

    3.  **Waiver of Jury Trial.** YOU AND SENTIENT HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY. You and Sentient are instead electing that all Disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, except as specified in Section 15(a) (Applicability of Arbitration Agreement). There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited review.

    4.  **Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief.** YOU AND SENTIENT AGREE THAT, EXCEPT AS SPECIFIED IN SECTION 15(k) (BATCH ARBITRATION, EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE, OR COLLECTIVE BASIS, AND THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO HAVE ANY DISPUTE BE BROUGHT, HEARD, ADMINISTERED, RESOLVED, OR ARBITRATED ON A CLASS, COLLECTIVE, REPRESENTATIVE, OR MASS ACTION BASIS. ONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS AVAILABLE, AND DISPUTES OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER. Subject to this Arbitration Agreement, the arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the partyʼs individual claim. Nothing in this paragraph is intended to, nor shall it, affect the terms and conditions under Section 15(k) (Batch Arbitration). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Arbitration Agreement, if a court decides by means of a final decision, not subject to any further appeal or recourse, that the limitations of this Section are invalid or unenforceable as to a particular claim or request for relief (such as a request for public injunctive relief), you and Sentient agree that that particular claim or request for relief (and only that particular claim or request for relief) shall be severed from the arbitration and may be litigated in the state or federal courts located in the State of Delaware. All other Disputes shall be arbitrated or litigated in small claims court. This Section does not prevent you or Sentient from participating in a class-wide settlement of claims.

    5.  **Rules.** This Agreement evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce; and notwithstanding any other provision herein with respect to the applicable substantive law, the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 *et seq.*, will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement and any arbitration proceedings. If the Informal Dispute Resolution process described above does not resolve satisfactorily within sixty 60 days after receipt of your Notice, you and Sentient agree that either party shall have the right to finally resolve the Dispute through binding arbitration. The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (**“AAAˮ**), in accordance with the Consumer Arbitration Rules (the **“AAA Rulesˮ**) then in effect, except as modified by this Section of this Arbitration Agreement. The AAA Rules are currently available at ht[tps://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/Consumer%20Rules.pdf.](http://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/Consumer%20Rules.pdf)

        1.  A party who wishes to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a request for arbitration (the **“Requestˮ**). The Request must include: (a) the name, telephone number, mailing address, e‐mail address of the party seeking arbitration and the account username (if applicable) as well as the email address associated with any applicable Account; (b) a statement of the legal claims being asserted and the factual bases of those claims; (c) a description of the remedy sought and an accurate, good‐faith calculation of the amount in controversy in United States dollars; (d) a statement certifying completion of the Informal Dispute Resolution process as described above; and (e) evidence that the requesting party has paid any necessary filing fees in connection with such arbitration.

        2.  If the party requesting arbitration is represented by counsel, the Request shall also include counselʼs name, telephone number, mailing address, and email address. Such counsel must also sign the Request. By signing the Request, counsel certifies to the best of counselʼs knowledge, information, and belief, formed after an inquiry reasonable under the circumstances, that: (i) the Request is not being presented for any improper purpose, such as to harass, cause unnecessary delay, or needlessly increase the cost of dispute resolution; (ii) the claims, defenses and other legal contentions are warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for extending, modifying, or reversing existing law or for establishing new law; and (iii) the factual and damages contentions have evidentiary support or, if specifically so identified, will likely have evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery.

&nbsp;

6.  **Forum.** Unless you and Sentient otherwise agree, or the Batch Arbitration process discussed in Section 15(k) (Batch Arbitration) is triggered, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside. Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator may direct a limited and reasonable exchange of information between the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration. If the AAA is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum. Your responsibility to pay any AAA fees and costs will be solely set forth in the applicable AAA Rules.

7.  **Confidentiality.** You and Sentient agree that all materials and documents exchanged during the arbitration proceedings shall be kept confidential and shall not be shared with anyone except the partiesʼ attorneys, accountants, or business advisors, and shall be subject to the condition that they agree to keep all materials and documents exchanged during the arbitration proceedings confidential.

8.  **Arbitrator.** The arbitrator will be selected by the parties from the AAAʼs roster of consumer dispute arbitrators. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within thirty-five 35 days of delivery of the Request, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules, provided that if the Batch Arbitration process under Section 15(k) (Batch Arbitration) is triggered, the AAA will appoint the arbitrator for each batch.

9.  **Authority of Arbitrator.** The arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to resolve any Dispute, including, without limitation, disputes arising out of or related to the interpretation or application of the Arbitration Agreement, including the enforceability, revocability, scope, or validity of the Arbitration Agreement or any portion of the Arbitration Agreement, except for the following: (a) all Disputes arising out of or relating to Section 15(d) (Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief), including any claim that all or part of Section 15(d) (Waiver of Class and Other Non- Individualized Relief) is unenforceable, illegal, void or voidable, or that such Section 15(d) (Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief) has been breached, shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator; (b) except as expressly contemplated in Section 15(k) (Batch Arbitration), all Disputes about the payment of arbitration fees shall be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator; (c) all Disputes about whether either party has satisfied any condition precedent to arbitration shall be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator; and (d) all Disputes about which version of the Arbitration Agreement applies shall be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. The arbitration proceeding will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties, except as expressly provided in Section 15(k) (Batch Arbitration). The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any Dispute. The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and us. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.

10. **Attorneysʼ Fees and Costs.** The parties shall bear their own attorneysʼ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of the Dispute or the relief sought in the Request was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)). If you or Sentient need to invoke the authority of a court of competent jurisdiction to compel arbitration, then the party that obtains an order compelling arbitration in such action shall have the right to collect from the other party its reasonable costs, necessary disbursements, and reasonable attorneysʼ fees incurred in securing an order compelling arbitration. The prevailing party in any court action relating to whether either party has satisfied any condition precedent to arbitration, including the Informal Dispute Resolution process, is entitled to recover their reasonable costs, necessary disbursements, and reasonable attorneysʼ fees and costs.

11. **Batch Arbitration.** To increase the efficiency of administration and resolution of arbitrations, you and Sentient agree that in the event that there are one-hundred 100 or more individual Requests of a substantially similar nature filed against Sentient by or with the assistance of the same law firm, group of law firms, or organizations, within a thirty 30 day period (or as soon as possible thereafter), the AAA shall (a) administer the arbitration demands in batches of 100 Requests per batch (plus, to the extent there are less than 100 Requests left over after the batching described above, a final batch consisting of the remaining Requests); (b) appoint one arbitrator for each batch; and (c) provide for the resolution of each batch as a single consolidated arbitration with one set of filing and administrative fees due per side per batch, one procedural calendar, one hearing (if any) in a place to be determined by the arbitrator, and one final award (**“Batch Arbitrationˮ**).

    1.  All parties agree that Requests are of a “substantially similar natureˮ if they arise out of or relate to the same event or factual scenario and raise the same or similar legal issues and seek the same or similar relief. To the extent the parties disagree on the application of the Batch Arbitration process, the disagreeing party shall advise the AAA, and the AAA shall appoint a sole standing arbitrator to determine the applicability of the Batch Arbitration process (**“Administrative Arbitratorˮ**). In an effort to expedite resolution of any such dispute by the Administrative Arbitrator, the parties agree the Administrative Arbitrator may set forth such procedures as are necessary to resolve any disputes promptly. The Administrative Arbitratorʼs fees shall be paid by Sentient.

    2.  You and Sentient agree to cooperate in good faith with the AAA to implement the Batch Arbitration process including the payment of single filing and administrative fees for batches of Requests, as well as any steps to minimize the time and costs of arbitration, which may include: (i) the appointment of a discovery special master to assist the arbitrator in the resolution of discovery disputes; and (ii) the adoption of an expedited calendar of the arbitration proceedings.

    3.  This Batch Arbitration provision shall in no way be interpreted as authorizing a class, collective and/or mass arbitration or action of any kind, or arbitration involving joint or consolidated claims under any circumstances, except as expressly set forth in this provision.
