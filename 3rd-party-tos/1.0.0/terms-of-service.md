# Sentient Third‑Party Terms of Service

Effective Date: April 28, 2025

Please read these Terms carefully before integrating or using the Sentient API. By accessing or using Sentient’s application programming interface and related services (collectively, the “API” or “Services”), you agree to be bound by these Third-Party Terms of Service (the “Terms”). These Terms form a binding agreement between you (an individual or the entity you represent) and Sentient (“Sentient,” “we,” “us,” or “our”). If you are using the API on behalf of an organization, you represent that you have the authority to bind that organization to these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, you must not use the API.
1. License to Use the API
Grant of Rights: Subject to your compliance with these Terms, Sentient grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide right to access and use our API and related developer tools during the Term to integrate the Services into your own applications, products, or services (“Your Application”). This grant permits you to allow end users of Your Application (“End Users”) to interact with the Services through Your Application.
Reservation of Rights: Except for the above express license, Sentient retains all right, title, and interest in and to the API, the Services, and all associated intellectual property. No rights are granted by implication. All rights not expressly granted to you are reserved by Sentient. You will not acquire any ownership interest in the API or underlying models, algorithms, or data.
API Credentials: You may be required to create an account and obtain API credentials (such as an API key or token) to use the API. Subject to these Terms, Sentient provides you with API credentials solely for your own use. These credentials are considered Sentient’s confidential information. You must not share, sell, sublicense, or transfer API keys or access tokens to any third party. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy and security of your API credentials.
2. Account Responsibilities
Account Security: You must provide accurate, current information when creating an account or registering for API access. You are responsible for all activities that occur under your account, including any actions by your employees, contractors, or End Users who access the API through Your Application. You agree to use reasonable efforts to protect your account and API credentials from unauthorized use. Unauthorized Use: If you become aware of any unauthorized access to your account or API keys, or any breach of security, you must notify Sentient promptly and take immediate steps to secure your account.
End User Management: You are responsible for the actions of End Users of Your Application as it relates to the API. You must ensure that all End Users comply with these Terms and any usage policies, and you agree that any violation by an End User will be deemed a violation by you. You may not enable any person or entity to use the API in violation of these Terms.
No Resale: You may embed or incorporate the API Services into Your Application for use by End Users, but you may not resell or redistribute the API or Services as a standalone offering without Sentient’s express written permission. You also may not charge End Users specifically for access to the Sentient API itself (as opposed to charging for your own application’s services) without a separate reseller agreement with Sentient.
3. Acceptable Use and Restrictions
Compliance with Laws and Policies: You agree to use the API only for lawful purposes, in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, and in accordance with any usage guidelines or acceptable use policies that Sentient may provide. You will not use the Services in any manner that violates any law, regulation, court order, or the rights of any individual or entity. Sentient may publish Service-specific usage policies (including content standards or developer guidelines), which are hereby incorporated into these Terms; you must comply with all such policies.
Prohibited Uses: You and Your Application (including your End Users) will not engage in any of the following prohibited activities when using the API or Services:
Unlawful or Harmful Content: You will not use the API to input, upload, generate, or disseminate any content that is illegal, harmful, violent, defamatory, obscene, fraudulent, or otherwise objectionable (including content that promotes hate, self-harm, terrorism, or violence). This includes not attempting to use the API to create any output that is unlawful or violates rights of others. You will also refrain from using the Services for any activity that is abusive, harassing, or invasive of another’s privacy or that could cause harm to minors.
Violation of Rights: You will not use the Services in a way that infringes, misappropriates, or violates any third party’s intellectual property rights or other proprietary rights. For example, you will not submit content as input that you do not have the right to use, and you will not use outputs from the API in violation of someone else’s copyrights, trademarks, privacy, or publicity rights.
Personal Data Restrictions: No sensitive personal data – you will not input or share via the API any personal data that is subject to special legal protections or regulations (e.g. health information under HIPAA, financial information, government-issued identifiers, or other highly sensitive personal information) unless you have Sentient’s prior written approval. In particular, you will not send us any personal information about children under 13 (or under the age of digital consent in your jurisdiction. You must also refrain from using the Services to process any personal data if prohibited by applicable law or if you lack proper consent. (See also Data Privacy in Section 6 below.)
API Misuse: You will not misuse the API or Services in ways that could harm the integrity, performance, or security of Sentient’s systems. This includes not attempting to undermine or circumvent any rate limits, security measures, or content filters. For example, you will not attempt to “jailbreak” or manipulate the API or underlying models to bypass content restrictions and produce disallowed outputsfile-lqqoqwawe32qjvnhknmwed. You also will not knowingly transmit any viruses, malware, or harmful code through API requestsfile-lqqoqwawe32qjvnhknmwed.
Reverse Engineering: You will not reverse engineer, decompile, copy, or attempt to extract the source code, algorithms, model parameters, architecture, or underlying components of the API or any Sentient models or software. Likewise, you will not use the API to discover underlying model weights or to create any derivative models that compete with Sentient’s Services (except as expressly permitted in these Terms or by Sentient in writing).
Competitive Use: You will not use the API or outputs to develop or improve a competing product or service in the field of AI models or APIs. In particular, you must not use any Output from the Services to train or enhance any artificial intelligence model that competes with Sentient’s offerings. (Using output data for analytic or non-competing purposes internally is allowed, but you may not use it to replicate our Services’ functionality.) Similarly, you will not use the Services for the benefit of a direct competitor of Sentient (for example, by providing access to the API to such a competitor without permission).
No Unauthorized Extraction or Sharing: You will only access the Services through the API endpoints and protocols provided by Sentient. Scraping or mass-extracting data or content from the Services by any automated means outside of the official API is prohibited. You also agree not to share, sell, or transfer any Output or data obtained from the API to any third party in a manner not permitted by these Terms. (Provision of Output to legitimate End Users of Your Application is allowed; bulk redistribution or publishing of raw outputs is not.)
API Key Use: You will not share your API key with unauthorized persons or use another party’s API key. Buying, selling, or trading API keys is strictly prohibited. All API requests must be authenticated with your own key. If Sentient suspects key sharing or unauthorized use, we may suspend your access.
Usage Monitoring: Sentient may monitor your use of the API (which may include reviewing API calls and outputs) to ensure quality, improve the Services, and verify compliance with these Terms and our policies. You agree that Sentient has the right to investigate any violation of these Terms or misuse of the Services. Violation of the above use restrictions may result in suspension or termination of your access (see Termination in Section 9) and may also result in legal consequences.
4. Developer Obligations
Compliance and Cooperation: You are responsible for ensuring that your use of the API and Your Application is in compliance with these Terms and all applicable laws (including data privacy, export control, and consumer protection laws). You agree to cooperate with Sentient’s reasonable requests and inquiries related to your use of the Services. This includes providing information or documents to verify your compliance with these Terms or to respond to any concern regarding misuse.
Audit Rights: Sentient reserves the right to audit or review your usage of the API to ensure compliance. With reasonable prior notice, Sentient may request to inspect your implementation or relevant records, or to have you run a self-audit, to confirm that you and your End Users are using the API in accordance with these Terms and our policies. You agree to provide prompt assistance and information as reasonably required by Sentient to facilitate any such audit or compliance check. Any such audit will be conducted during normal business hours and in a manner that minimizes disruption to your business. If an audit reveals any material non-compliance, you will rectify it promptly, and Sentient may take enforcement action under these Terms.
End User Terms: If you provide API functionality to End Users (for example, in Your Application), you must do so under terms of service and a privacy policy that are consistent with (and no less protective of Sentient and the Services than) these Terms. This means, for example, your own end user terms should prohibit the same types of conduct listed in Section 3 and should properly notify End Users that content may be AI-generated. You must include appropriate disclosures or notices to End Users regarding the nature of the AI Services (such as informing users that outputs are generated by AI and may not be accurate or complete, where applicable. You will be solely responsible for any interactions between your End Users and Your Application, and for addressing any complaints, issues, or claims arising from such use.
Responsibility for Use: You acknowledge that AI systems have inherent limitations and that Outputs may be incorrect, inaccurate, or misleading. You are responsible for evaluating all Outputs provided through the API for appropriateness to your use case before using or disseminating them. Human oversight is recommended, especially in sensitive or high-stakes contexts. Sentient does not guarantee the factual accuracy or reliability of any Output. You agree not to represent any Output as professional advice (legal, medical, financial, etc.) or absolute truth, and you will ensure that End Users understand they should not rely on Outputs without independent verification.
5. Intellectual Property and Content Ownership
Your Content – Input and Output: As used in these Terms, “Input” means any data, information, text, audio, images, or other content that you (or your End Users) submit to the API or otherwise provide to Sentient for processing. “Output” means any data or content generated by the Services in response to an Input and returned to you. Collectively, “Your Content” refers to Input and Output together.
Ownership of Input: You retain ownership of all of your Input. Sentient does not claim any ownership rights in the Input you provide. By submitting Input, you represent that you have sufficient rights and authority to provide that Input to the Services and that doing so will not violate any law or any third-party rights. You grant Sentient a license to use your Input solely as necessary to provide the Services to you and to monitor for and prevent abuse (e.g., to comply with our security and usage policies). This license includes the right for us to process, transmit, and display the Input to generate Outputs, and to store the Input and Output for a limited time as needed for service delivery (for example, caching or debugging), subject to our data handling obligations in Section 6.
Ownership of Output: Except as may be limited by applicable law or by third-party rights in any portion of the Output, you own all Outputs generated from your Inputs, as between you and Sentient. To the extent any Output is considered Sentient’s intellectual property, we hereby assign to you all our right, title, and interest in and to that Output. This assignment is effective upon creation of the Output. This means you may use, reproduce, modify, and distribute Outputs from the API for any lawful purpose, subject to your compliance with these Terms (including the usage restrictions in Section 3). Note: This does not grant you any rights to Sentient’s underlying models or Service itself, but ensures you have rights in the content the AI generates for you. You acknowledge that similar or identical Outputs may be generated for other users, and nothing in these Terms prohibits Sentient from serving other customers or from independently developing content similar to your Output.
No Use of Your Content for Model Training: Sentient will not use Your Content (Inputs or Outputs) to train or improve our AI models or Services without your explicit permission. Any processing of Your Content is limited to providing the Services to you and ensuring compliance with these Terms. (Aggregated, anonymized usage data that does not identify you or Your Content may be used to improve Service performance and capabilities, but not in a way that incorporates your proprietary Content into our model knowledge base.)
Sentient Intellectual Property: The API and Services (including all software, technology, models, algorithms, data (excluding Your Content), documentation, websites, and content provided by Sentient) are the valuable intellectual property of Sentient and its licensors. Sentient and its suppliers own all rights, title, and interest in and to the Services and API, including all improvements, enhancements, or modifications thereto. You shall not remove or obscure any copyright, trademark, or proprietary rights notices on the Sentient materials. Except for Your Content as described above, Sentient does not grant you any ownership or rights in any intellectual property by entering into or performing this Agreement. You agree not to assert any ownership interest in the Services, models, or any part of our intellectual property.
Feedback: If you elect to provide any suggestions, ideas, feedback, or recommendations to Sentient regarding the API or Services (“Feedback”), we may use and incorporate your Feedback without any obligation to you. You hereby grant Sentient a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free license to use and exploit any such Feedback for any purpose. This helps us improve our products, and you agree that Feedback is given voluntarily and will not be treated as your confidential information.
6. Data Privacy
Privacy Compliance: Each party agrees to comply with applicable data protection and privacy laws with respect to personal data processed in connection with the Services. You are responsible for providing any required notices to individuals and obtaining any necessary consents from them for processing of personal data via the Services. For example, if End Users will input personal data into Your Application that utilizes the API, you must ensure you have the legal right to collect and share that data with Sentient for processing.
Data Processing Addendum: If you (or your End Users) will be submitting personal data subject to GDPR or similar regulations, and Sentient is a processor of that data, you will enter into Sentient’s Data Processing Addendum (“DPA”). The DPA will set forth respective obligations for privacy and security as required by law. In the event of any conflict between these Terms and the DPA with respect to personal data, the terms of the DPA will prevail. You can request and execute a DPA with Sentient if applicable.
Restrictions on Sensitive Data: Unless you have a separate written agreement with Sentient (such as a HIPAA business associate agreement or other addendum), you agree not to use the API to process any sensitive personal data that would impose specific data security or compliance obligations on Sentient beyond standard privacy law requirements. This includes, without limitation, health information regulated by HIPAA (unless a Healthcare Addendum is in place) credit card data subject to PCI-DSS, government-issued identification numbers, financial account passwords, biometric identifiers, or any other information defined as “sensitive” or “special category” personal data under relevant laws that you are not authorized or permitted to process via the Services.
International Transfers: Sentient is a global service provider. By using the API, you understand and consent that personal data input into the API may be transferred to and processed in the United States or other jurisdictions where Sentient or its subprocessors operate, consistent with applicable law. Sentient will implement appropriate safeguards for cross-border transfers as required (such as Standard Contractual Clauses for EU data, if applicable).
Our Privacy Policy: Use of the Services is also subject to Sentient’s Privacy Policy, which describes how we collect, use, and disclose personal information (for example, account registration data or log data) when you use our website and Services. Our Privacy Policy is incorporated into these Terms by reference. By using the API, you acknowledge our data practices as outlined in the Privacy Policy.
7. Security
Sentient’s Security Measures: Sentient is committed to keeping the Services secure. We maintain an information security program with administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect the Services and Your Content against unauthorized access, loss, or disclosure. This includes measures like access controls, encryption in transit, network security monitoring, and regular security assessments in line with industry best practices. While we strive to protect the system, no service can be guaranteed to be 100% secure or error-free.
Your Security Obligations: You are responsible for the security of Your Applications and systems that interface with the API. This means you should employ industry-standard security measures in your own environment, including protecting your API keys (as noted), using up-to-date software, and preventing unauthorized access to Sentient’s Services via your integration. Data Security: If you store or cache any Output or retain any personal data from the API on your systems, you must do so securely and in compliance with applicable data protection laws.
Incident Notification: In the event you discover any security vulnerabilities or incidents that could impact the API or the data processed through it, you agree to promptly notify Sentient and cooperate with us to address the issue. Similarly, Sentient will notify you without undue delay of any confirmed data breach on our systems that materially affects Your Content, in accordance with applicable law.
User Credentials: If Your Application involves issuing credentials to End Users (such as account logins) that in turn have access to the API, you are responsible for ensuring those credentials are managed securely. You should require strong passwords or authentication methods and protect End User accounts from unauthorized use. Sentient has no liability for breaches resulting from your failure to secure Your Application or End User accounts.
8. Confidentiality
Definition of Confidential Information: “Confidential Information” means any non-public information, in any form, disclosed by one party (“Discloser”) to the other (“Recipient”) that is identified as confidential or proprietary, or that should reasonably be understood to be confidential given the nature of the information and the context of disclosure. Confidential Information includes, without limitation: (i) for Sentient, all aspects of the API and Services that are not publicly known (such as source code, technology, algorithms, roadmaps, pricing information, or non-public documentation), as well as any usage statistics or performance data; (ii) for you, any non-public Input you provide (to the extent it is not incorporated into an Output provided back to you) and any non-public information about your business plans or technology; and (iii) any other information designated by the Discloser as confidential. Output generated by the Service for you is not considered Sentient’s Confidential Information (it is Your Content as defined), except to the extent it contains or reveals aspects of the Service that are not publicly known.
Exclusions: Confidential Information does not include information that the Recipient can demonstrate: (a) is or becomes publicly available without breach of any obligation by the Recipient (e.g. was published or generally known through no fault of Recipient); (b) was already known to the Recipient, free of any confidentiality obligations, before disclosure by the Discloser; (c) is independently developed by the Recipient without use of or reference to the Discloser’s Confidential Information; or (d) is obtained lawfully from a third party who has the right to disclose it without confidentiality obligation.
Use and Non-Disclosure: The Recipient of any Confidential Information agrees to hold it in strict confidence and not to use it for any purpose outside the scope of these Terms. The Recipient will use the same degree of care to protect the Discloser’s Confidential Information that it uses to protect its own confidential information of a similar nature, but no less than reasonable care. The Recipient shall not disclose Confidential Information to any third party, except to its and its affiliates’ employees, contractors, or advisors (“Representatives”) who need to know it for the purpose of exercising rights or fulfilling obligations under these Terms and who are bound by confidentiality obligations at least as protective as these Terms. The Recipient will be liable for any breach of this Section by its Representatives.
Compelled Disclosure: If the Recipient is legally compelled by law, court order, or regulatory authority to disclose the Discloser’s Confidential Information, the Recipient may do so, provided that (unless prohibited by law) the Recipient gives the Discloser prompt written notice to allow the Discloser an opportunity to seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy to prevent or limit the disclosure. The Recipient will disclose only that portion of Confidential Information which it is legally required to disclose and will use reasonable efforts to ensure any information so disclosed is accorded confidential treatment.
Return or Destruction: Upon the Discloser’s written request, the Recipient will promptly return or destroy all Confidential Information of the Discloser in its possession or control. However, the Recipient may retain copies of Confidential Information that are stored in automatic backup systems or that must be retained to comply with legal requirements or for routine archival purposes, provided that any retained information remains subject to the confidentiality obligations herein for as long as it is retained. This Section 8 will survive termination of these Terms for a period of five (5) years (or indefinitely with respect to any trade secrets, personal data, or highly sensitive information).
9. Term and Termination
Term: These Terms commence on the date you first accept them or first access the API, whichever is earlier, and will remain in effect until terminated as set forth herein (the “Term”).
Termination by You: You may terminate these Terms for any reason by discontinuing use of the API and closing your Sentient account (if any), upon written notice to Sentient. If you have a separate subscription or order form for the API, you may terminate per the terms of that arrangement (subject to any minimum commitment).
Termination or Suspension by Sentient: Sentient may suspend or terminate your access to the API or these Terms at its discretion upon notice to you if: (a) you materially breach any provision of these Terms (including any policies) and fail to cure the breach within 10 days after notice from Sentient (or immediately if cure is not feasible); (b) your use of the Services violates any applicable law or regulation or could subject Sentient to legal liability; (c) Sentient reasonably determines that you or your End Users are misusing the API or causing harm to the Services or other users (for example, causing network disruption, launching denial of service attacks, or using the API for disallowed content); (d) any partner or vendor whose services or data Sentient relies on to provide the API terminates or suspends their relationship with Sentient, making it impracticable to continue offering the API; or (e) Sentient decides to discontinue the API or Service (in which case Sentient will provide you as much prior notice as reasonably practicable). Additionally, Sentient may suspend your API access immediately during any period of investigation of suspected misuse or breach of these Terms, or if required by law enforcement or government order.
Effect of Termination: Upon any termination of these Terms or suspension of your API access, you must immediately stop using the API and delete any API keys or authentication credentials. If requested, each party will return or destroy the other party’s Confidential Information (per Section 8). Any rights or obligations that by their nature should survive termination (such as accrued payment obligations, indemnification, confidentiality, disclaimers, and limits of liability) shall survive. Termination of these Terms will not relieve either party from liability for any breach that occurred prior to termination.
No Liability for Termination: Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, neither party will be liable to the other for any costs or damages resulting from a termination of these Terms in accordance with its terms. If Sentient terminates these Terms without cause (i.e., not due to your breach or other reason under (a)–(e) above), and you have prepaid fees for a subscription term not yet ended, Sentient will refund the prorated portion of any prepaid fees covering the remaining period. Otherwise, no refunds will be due.
10. Indemnification
10.1 Indemnification by Sentient: Sentient will defend you (and your officers, directors, and employees, as applicable) against any third-party claim, demand, suit, or legal proceeding alleging that the Sentient Services or API (as provided by Sentient) infringe or misappropriate a third party’s copyright, trademark, or patent, or unlawfully use a third party’s trade secret (an “IP Claim”). Sentient will indemnify you against any damages, attorneys’ fees, and costs finally awarded by a court or agreed in settlement for such IP Claim. If the Services or API are found to infringe, or if Sentient believes they may be subject to an IP Claim, Sentient, at its option, may: (a) procure the right for you to continue using the Services; (b) modify or replace the Services or API to make them non-infringing; or (c) if (a) and (b) are not commercially feasible, terminate your use of the Services and refund any pre-paid fees for unused Services. Sentient will have no liability or obligation under this section for any IP Claim to the extent arising from: (i) your combination of the Services with products or data not supplied by Sentient; (ii) modifications you make to the API or models (other than as contemplated by the documentation); (iii) your failure to use any updates or patches provided by Sentient to avoid a claim; or (iv) Input, Output, or other content provided by you or your End Users. This Section 10.1 states your sole and exclusive remedy for any intellectual property infringement by the Services or API.
10.2 Indemnification by You: You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Sentient and its affiliates, and their officers, directors, employees, and agents, from and against any and all third-party claims, demands, suits, or proceedings (“Claims”) and any associated liabilities, damages, losses, settlements, fines, or expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) that arise out of or relate to: (a) Your Content (Inputs or Outputs) or any data you or your End Users provide through the Services; (b) your use of the API or Services in violation of these Terms or of any law or regulation (including use of the API to create or disseminate content allegedly violating a third party’s rights or applicable law); or (c) Your Application, including any claims by End Users or other third parties arising from Your Application’s use of or interaction with the API (for example, product liability or misrepresentation claims relating to Your Application). You also agree to indemnify Sentient for any fines or penalties imposed on Sentient due to your use of the Services in violation of any law (such as data privacy or export control laws).
10.3 Indemnification Procedure: The party seeking indemnification under this Section 10 (the “Indemnified Party”) must promptly notify the other party (the “Indemnifying Party”) in writing of any Claim for which it seeks indemnification. The Indemnifying Party will assume the defense of the Claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party will cooperate in the defense, at the Indemnifying Party’s expense, and may join in the defense with its own counsel at its own expense. The Indemnifying Party will not settle any Claim without the Indemnified Party’s prior written consent, unless the settlement fully releases the Indemnified Party of all liability and does not require admission of fault or payment of money by the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnifying Party fails to promptly assume the defense, the Indemnified Party may defend the Claim at the Indemnifying Party’s expense.
10.4 Exclusions: Neither party is obligated to indemnify the other to the extent any Claim is caused by the Indemnified Party’s own willful misconduct, gross negligence, or breach of these Terms.
11. Disclaimers
AS-IS Basis: Except as expressly provided in these Terms, the API and Services are provided “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE” without any warranty of any kind. Use of the Sentient API is at your and your End Users’ own risk. Sentient, on behalf of itself and its licensors, expressly disclaims all warranties, whether express, implied, or statutory, including but not limited to implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. No oral or written advice or information obtained from Sentient or elsewhere shall create any warranty not expressly stated in these Terms.
Service Performance: Sentient makes no representation or warranty that the Services will meet your requirements, achieve any intended results, or operate in an uninterrupted, secure, or error-free manner. We do not guarantee that the Services will be available 24/7 or that they will be free of delays, downtimes, or defects. Any scheduled downtime or maintenance will be communicated as feasible, but Sentient is not liable for any unavailability or data loss.
Outputs and Accuracy: Sentient makes no warranty or guarantee regarding the accuracy, quality, or reliability of any Outputs generated by the AI models. You understand that Outputs may be incomplete, inaccurate, factually incorrect, harmful, or otherwise problematic. Sentient does not warrant that using the Outputs will not pose issues or liabilities. You are solely responsible for how you use and interpret any Output, and for any consequences of using or relying on Output. Sentient disclaims any liability for decisions or actions taken based on Output. No Professional Advice: Outputs are not guaranteed to constitute professional or expert advice. If Your Application provides outputs in domains like law, medicine, or finance, it must do so under your own responsibility and with appropriate disclaimers to End Users.
No Other Warranties: Sentient does not warrant that the Services will be free from viruses or other harmful components, or that any content (including Your Content) will be secure or not otherwise lost or damaged. Any beta or trial services are provided “as-is” without any warranties whatsoever. Sentient is not responsible for any third-party services or content (including Third-Party Features or APIs not provided by Sentient) that you use in conjunction with our API. You are solely responsible for evaluating and complying with any third-party services.
Statutory Rights: In jurisdictions that do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties, some of the above disclaimers may not apply to you. In such cases, Sentient’s warranties are limited to the minimum extent required by law.
12. Limitation of Liability
Indirect Damages: To the maximum extent permitted by law, neither party will be liable under these Terms for any indirect, special, incidental, consequential, punitive, or exemplary damages whatsoever, or for damages for loss of profits, loss of revenue, loss of goodwill, loss of data, business interruption, or procurement of substitute services, arising out of or in connection with the API or these Terms, even if that party has been advised of the possibility of such damages. These exclusions apply regardless of the legal theory of liability (contract, tort, negligence, strict liability, or otherwise) and even if any limited remedy herein is found to have failed its essential purpose.
Cap on Liability: Each party’s total cumulative liability arising out of or relating to these Terms or the use of the API, from all causes of action and under all theories of liability, will not exceed the total amount of fees paid or payable by you to Sentient for use of the API in the 12 months immediately prior to the event giving rise to the liability. If you have not paid any fees (for example, if you are on a free plan), Sentient’s total liability shall not exceed USD $100. This limitation is an aggregate cap for all claims in a given period and is not per-incident.
Exceptions: The limitations and exclusions of liability in this Section 12 shall not apply to: (i) your indemnification obligations under Section 10.2, (ii) your liability for fees owed, (iii) either party’s liability for unauthorized use or misuse of the other party’s intellectual property (including breach of license restrictions in Section 3 or confidentiality obligations in Section 8), or (iv) liability for fraud, willful misconduct, or personal injury/death (to the extent such liability cannot be limited under law). Additionally, Sentient’s liability cap will not apply to its indemnification obligations under Section 10.1 (i.e., in the event of an IP Claim defense).
Clarifications: The parties agree that the limitations of liability are a fundamental part of the bargain and risk allocation under these Terms, and that absent such limitations, the fees (if any) charged for the Services would be different. These limitations shall apply even if any limited remedy fails of its essential purpose. If applicable law limits the application of the above liability limitations, they will apply to the fullest extent permitted.
13. Audit and Compliance Verification
To ensure the integrity of our platform and compliance with these Terms, Sentient reserves certain audit and verification rights.
Monitoring Use: As noted, Sentient may monitor usage of the API, which can include automated tools that analyze API requests and outputs for potential violations (e.g., abuse detection systems). You consent to such monitoring and agree that it does not violate any duty of confidentiality either party owes to the other, provided it is used solely for the purposes of enforcing these Terms, improving the Service, or complying with law.
Audit Rights: Upon at least 10 business days’ notice, Sentient (or its designated independent auditor) may audit your use of the API for compliance. We will conduct audits during normal business hours and in a manner that minimizes disruption. You agree to reasonably cooperate with any such audit, including by providing information or access to personnel or systems as reasonably requested. Sentient may require you to provide a written certification signed by an officer attesting to your compliance with these Terms. If an audit reveals unlicensed use of the API or other material breaches, you shall reimburse Sentient for the reasonable cost of the audit (in addition to any other remedies).
Government Compliance: If a regulatory or law enforcement authority requests information about your use of the API and we are obligated to respond, you agree to cooperate with Sentient in furnishing such information as needed. Conversely, if you receive any governmental inquiry or notice regarding the Services (such as a subpoena or data access request concerning the API or outputs), you should notify Sentient promptly, unless legally prohibited, so that we may respond appropriately.
Remediation: Sentient will notify you in writing if any audit or monitoring discovers your violation of these Terms. You agree to promptly address and remedy any confirmed violation. Sentient may, in its discretion, temporarily suspend your access to the API during the cure period if continuing usage is likely to cause harm or legal risk. Once compliance is re-established, we will reinstate suspended access as appropriate.
This Section 13 (Audit and Compliance) does not limit any other rights or remedies Sentient may have under these Terms or at law to address violations.
14. General Provisions
Governing Law: These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the the Country of Singapore, excluding its conflict of laws principles. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods does not apply. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you are located outside the United States, any mandatory consumer protection or data protection laws in your country of residence that would apply to you and cannot be waived by contract will remain applicable to the extent required by law.
ARBITRATION AGREEMENT. Please read this Section (the “Arbitration Agreement”) carefully. It is part of your contract with Sentient and affects your rights. It contains procedures for MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION AND A CLASS ACTION WAIVER.
Applicability of Arbitration Agreement. Subject to the terms of this Arbitration Agreement, you and Sentient agree that any dispute, claim, disagreements arising out of or relating in any way to your access to or use of any Service (including the Website and/or the Apps), any communications you receive, any products sold or distributed through the Service or this Agreement and prior versions of this Agreement, including claims and disputes that arose between you and us before the effective date of this Agreement (each, a “Dispute”) will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that: (a) you and Sentient may assert claims or seek relief in small claims court if such claims qualify and remain in small claims court; and (b) you or Sentient may seek equitable relief in court for infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, and patents). For purposes of this Arbitration Agreement, “Dispute” will also include disputes that arose or involve facts occurring before the existence of this or any prior versions of this Agreement as well as claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement. This Arbitration Agreement does not apply to claims involving alleged violations of regulatory compliance matters, or any claim where injunctive relief is sought by a government entity.
Informal Dispute Resolution. There might be instances when a Dispute arises between you and Sentient. If that occurs, Sentient is committed to working with you to reach a reasonable resolution. You and Sentient agree that good faith informal efforts to resolve Disputes can result in a prompt, low‐cost and mutually beneficial outcome (“Informal Dispute Resolution”). You and Sentient therefore agree that before either party commences arbitration against the other (or initiates an action in small claims court if a party so elects), we will personally meet and confer telephonically or via videoconference, in a good faith effort to resolve informally any Dispute covered by this Arbitration Agreement (“Informal Dispute Resolution Conference”). If you are represented by counsel, your counsel may participate in the conference, but you will also participate in the conference.
The party initiating a Dispute must give notice to the other party in writing of its intent to initiate an Informal Dispute Resolution Conference (“Notice”), which shall occur within forty-five (45) days after the other party receives such Notice, unless an extension is mutually agreed upon by the parties. Notice to Sentient that you intend to initiate an Informal Dispute Resolution Conference should be sent by email to contact@sentient.xyz. The Notice must include: (1) your name, telephone number, mailing address, e‐mail address associated with your Account (if you have one); (2) the name, telephone number, mailing address and e‐mail address of your counsel, if any; and (3) a description of your Dispute.
The Informal Dispute Resolution Conference shall be individualized such that a separate conference must be held each time either party initiates a Dispute, even if the same law firm or group of law firms represents multiple users in similar cases, unless all parties agree; multiple individuals initiating a Dispute cannot participate in the same Informal Dispute Resolution Conference unless all parties agree. In the time between a party receiving the Notice and the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference, nothing in this Arbitration Agreement shall prohibit the parties from engaging in informal communications to resolve the initiating party’s Dispute. Engaging in the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference is a condition precedent and requirement that must be fulfilled before commencing arbitration. The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference process required by this Section.
Waiver of Jury Trial. YOU AND SENTIENT HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY. You and Sentient are instead electing that all Disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, except as specified in Section 15.1 (Applicability of Arbitration Agreement). There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited review.
Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief. YOU AND SENTIENT AGREE THAT, EXCEPT AS SPECIFIED IN SECTION 15.9 (BATCH ARBITRATION), EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE, OR COLLECTIVE BASIS, AND THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO HAVE ANY DISPUTE BE BROUGHT, HEARD, ADMINISTERED, RESOLVED, OR ARBITRATED ON A CLASS, COLLECTIVE, REPRESENTATIVE, OR MASS ACTION BASIS. ONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS AVAILABLE, AND DISPUTES OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER. Subject to this Arbitration Agreement, the arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the party’s individual claim. Nothing in this paragraph is intended to, nor shall it, affect the terms and conditions under Section 15.9 (Batch Arbitration). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Arbitration Agreement, if a court decides by means of a final decision, not subject to any further appeal or recourse, that the limitations of this Section are invalid or unenforceable as to a particular claim or request for relief (such as a request for public injunctive relief), you and Sentient agree that that particular claim or request for relief (and only that particular claim or request for relief) shall be severed from the arbitration and may be litigated in the state or federal courts located in the State of Delaware. All other Disputes shall be arbitrated or litigated in small claims court. This Section does not prevent you or Sentient from participating in a class-wide settlement of claims.
Rules and Forum. This Agreement evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce; and notwithstanding any other provision herein with respect to the applicable substantive law, the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq., will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement and any arbitration proceedings. If the Informal Dispute Resolution process described above does not resolve satisfactorily within sixty (60) days after receipt of your Notice, you and Sentient agree that either party shall have the right to finally resolve the Dispute through binding arbitration. The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), in accordance with the Consumer Arbitration Rules (the “AAA Rules”) then in effect, except as modified by this Section of this Arbitration Agreement. The AAA Rules are currently available at https://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/Consumer%20Rules.pdf.
A party who wishes to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a request for arbitration (the “Request”). The Request must include: (a) the name, telephone number, mailing address, e‐mail address of the party seeking arbitration and the account username (if applicable) as well as the email address associated with any applicable Account; (b) a statement of the legal claims being asserted and the factual bases of those claims; (c) a description of the remedy sought and an accurate, good‐faith calculation of the amount in controversy in United States dollars; (d) a statement certifying completion of the Informal Dispute Resolution process as described above; and (e) evidence that the requesting party has paid any necessary filing fees in connection with such arbitration.
If the party requesting arbitration is represented by counsel, the Request shall also include counsel’s name, telephone number, mailing address, and email address. Such counsel must also sign the Request. By signing the Request, counsel certifies to the best of counsel’s knowledge, information, and belief, formed after an inquiry reasonable under the circumstances, that: (i) the Request is not being presented for any improper purpose, such as to harass, cause unnecessary delay, or needlessly increase the cost of dispute resolution; (ii) the claims, defenses and other legal contentions are warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for extending, modifying, or reversing existing law or for establishing new law; and (iii) the factual and damages contentions have evidentiary support or, if specifically so identified, will likely have evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery.
Unless you and Sentient otherwise agree, or the Batch Arbitration process discussed in Section 15.9 (Batch Arbitration) is triggered, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside. Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator may direct a limited and reasonable exchange of information between the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration. If the AAA is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum. Your responsibility to pay any AAA fees and costs will be solely set forth in the applicable AAA Rules.
You and Sentient agree that all materials and documents exchanged during the arbitration proceedings shall be kept confidential and shall not be shared with anyone except the parties’ attorneys, accountants, or business advisors, and shall be subject to the condition that they agree to keep all materials and documents exchanged during the arbitration proceedings confidential.
Arbitrator. The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law in the state of Delaware and will be selected by the parties from the AAA’s roster of consumer dispute arbitrators. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within thirty-five (35) days of delivery of the Request, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules, provided that if the Batch Arbitration process under Section 15.9 (Batch Arbitration) is triggered, the AAA will appoint the arbitrator for each batch.
Authority of Arbitrator. The arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to resolve any Dispute, including, without limitation, disputes arising out of or related to the interpretation or application of the Arbitration Agreement, including the enforceability, revocability, scope, or validity of the Arbitration Agreement or any portion of the Arbitration Agreement, except for the following: (a) all Disputes arising out of or relating to Section 15.4 (Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief), including any claim that all or part of Section 15.4 (Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief) is unenforceable, illegal, void or voidable, or that such Section 15.4 (Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief) has been breached, shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator; (b) except as expressly contemplated in Section 15.9 (Batch Arbitration), all Disputes about the payment of arbitration fees shall be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator; (c) all Disputes about whether either party has satisfied any condition precedent to arbitration shall be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator; and (d) all Disputes about which version of the Arbitration Agreement applies shall be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. The arbitration proceeding will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties, except as expressly provided in Section 15.9 (Batch Arbitration). The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any Dispute. The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and us. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.
Attorneys’ Fees and Costs. The parties shall bear their own attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of the Dispute or the relief sought in the Request was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)). If you or Sentient need to invoke the authority of a court of competent jurisdiction to compel arbitration, then the party that obtains an order compelling arbitration in such action shall have the right to collect from the other party its reasonable costs, necessary disbursements, and reasonable attorneys’ fees incurred in securing an order compelling arbitration. The prevailing party in any court action relating to whether either party has satisfied any condition precedent to arbitration, including the Informal Dispute Resolution process, is entitled to recover their reasonable costs, necessary disbursements, and reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs.
Batch Arbitration. To increase the efficiency of administration and resolution of arbitrations, you and Sentient agree that in the event that there are one-hundred (100) or more individual Requests of a substantially similar nature filed against Sentient by or with the assistance of the same law firm, group of law firms, or organizations, within a thirty (30) day period (or as soon as possible thereafter), the AAA shall (a) administer the arbitration demands in batches of 100 Requests per batch (plus, to the extent there are less than 100 Requests left over after the batching described above, a final batch consisting of the remaining Requests); (b) appoint one arbitrator for each batch; and (c) provide for the resolution of each batch as a single consolidated arbitration with one set of filing and administrative fees due per side per batch, one procedural calendar, one hearing (if any) in a place to be determined by the arbitrator, and one final award (“Batch Arbitration”).
All parties agree that Requests are of a “substantially similar nature” if they arise out of or relate to the same event or factual scenario and raise the same or similar legal issues and seek the same or similar relief. To the extent the parties disagree on the application of the Batch Arbitration process, the disagreeing party shall advise the AAA, and the AAA shall appoint a sole standing arbitrator to determine the applicability of the Batch Arbitration process (“Administrative Arbitrator”). In an effort to expedite resolution of any such dispute by the Administrative Arbitrator, the parties agree the Administrative Arbitrator may set forth such procedures as are necessary to resolve any disputes promptly. The Administrative Arbitrator’s fees shall be paid by Sentient.
You and Sentient agree to cooperate in good faith with the AAA to implement the Batch Arbitration process including the payment of single filing and administrative fees for batches of Requests, as well as any steps to minimize the time and costs of arbitration, which may include: (i) the appointment of a discovery special master to assist the arbitrator in the resolution of discovery disputes; and (ii) the adoption of an expedited calendar of the arbitration proceedings.
This Batch Arbitration provision shall in no way be interpreted as authorizing a class, collective and/or mass arbitration or action of any kind, or arbitration involving joint or consolidated claims under any circumstances, except as expressly set forth in this provision.
30-Day Right to Opt Out. You have the right to opt out of the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to: contact@sentient.xyz within thirty (30) days after first becoming subject to this Arbitration Agreement. Your notice must include your name and address, the email address associated with your Account (if you have one), and an unequivocal statement that you want to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement. If you opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, all other parts of this Agreement will continue to apply to you. Opting out of this Arbitration Agreement has no effect on any other arbitration agreements that you may currently have, or may enter in the future, with us.
Invalidity, Expiration. Except as provided in Section 15.4 (Waiver of Class or Other Non-Individualized Relief), if any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall continue in full force and effect. You further agree that any Dispute that you have with Sentient as detailed in this Arbitration Agreement must be initiated via arbitration within the applicable statute of limitation for that claim or controversy, or it will be forever time barred. Likewise, you agree that all applicable statutes of limitation will apply to such arbitration in the same manner as those statutes of limitation would apply in the applicable court of competent jurisdiction.
Modification. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if Sentient makes any future material change to this Arbitration Agreement, we will notify you. Unless you reject the change within thirty (30) days of such change becoming effective in writing to Sentient at contact@sentient.xyz your continued use of the Service, including the acceptance of products and services offered on the Service following the posting of changes to this Arbitration Agreement constitutes your acceptance of any such changes. Changes to this Arbitration Agreement do not provide you with a new opportunity to opt out of the Arbitration Agreement if you have previously agreed to a version of this Agreement and did not validly opt out of arbitration. If you reject any change or update to this Arbitration Agreement, and you were bound by an existing agreement to arbitrate Disputes arising out of or relating in any way to your access to or use of the Service, any communications you receive, any products sold or distributed through the Service or this Agreement, the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement as of the date you first accepted this Agreement (or accepted any subsequent changes to this Agreement) remain in full force and effect. Sentient will continue to honor any valid opt outs of the Arbitration Agreement that you made to a prior version of this Agreement.
Changes to Terms: Sentient may update or modify these Terms from time to time. We will provide notice of material changes (for example, by posting the updated Terms on our website and updating the “Effective Date” or by email notification). Unless a later effective date is specified, changes will become effective 10 days after posting. Your continued use of the API after the effective date of any changes constitutes your acceptance of the updated Terms. If you do not agree to the changes, you must stop using the API. No amendment or modification to these Terms will be binding unless (i) in writing and signed by an authorized representative of each party, or (ii) posted by Sentient as described and not objected to by you within the stated notice period.
Entire Agreement: These Terms (including any referenced documents like the Privacy Policy, Usage Policy, or DPA) constitute the entire agreement between you and Sentient regarding the API and Services, and supersede all prior or contemporaneous agreements, understandings, or communications, whether written or oral, relating to the subject matter. In the event of a conflict between these Terms and any other agreements between you and Sentient, these Terms will prevail with respect to the API usage (unless the other agreement expressly overrides these Terms in writing, e.g., a negotiated enterprise contract).
Assignment: You may not assign or transfer these Terms (in whole or in part) or any rights or obligations hereunder without Sentient’s prior written consent, except you may assign these Terms in their entirety as part of a merger, acquisition, or sale of substantially all of your assets. Sentient may assign or transfer this agreement freely to an affiliate or in connection with a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets. Any purported assignment in violation of this section is void. These Terms will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective permitted successors and assigns.
No Waiver: The failure of either party to enforce any provision of these Terms will not constitute a waiver of that party’s rights to subsequently enforce the same or any other provision. Remedies: Except as expressly provided otherwise in these Terms, the rights and remedies of the parties provided herein are cumulative and not exclusive of any other rights or remedies at law or in equity.
Severability: If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect. The parties will negotiate in good faith a valid and enforceable provision that is as close as possible to the original intent of the invalid provision.
Third-Party Beneficiaries: These Terms are for the benefit of the parties and their successors and permitted assigns. They are not intended to confer any rights or remedies on any other person or entity, except for Sentient’s licensors and providers to the extent expressly stated in these Terms (for example, the disclaimer of warranties and limitations of liability shall extend to Sentient’s technology suppliers and hosting providers as intended third-party beneficiaries. Apart from the foregoing, no third party shall have the right to enforce any provision of these Terms.
Relationship of the Parties: Nothing in these Terms creates any agency, partnership, or joint venture between the parties. Each party is an independent contractor. Neither party has any authority to bind the other or act on behalf of the other.
Notices: All legal notices or communications required or permitted under these Terms shall be in writing and shall be deemed given: (a) when delivered personally; (b) when sent by email to the email address on record for your account or to legal@sentient.com (in the case of notice to Sentient) – provided no bounce-back or error message is received; or (c) one business day after being sent by reputable overnight courier to the addresses of the parties (or, if no address is provided for you, to any address associated with your account or payment information). You are responsible for keeping your contact information up to date. Notices regarding changes to these Terms may be given by general posting on the Sentient website or via the API service itself.
Force Majeure: Neither party will be liable for any delay or failure to perform its obligations (except payment obligations) under these Terms due to events beyond its reasonable control, such as strikes, accidents, acts of nature, war, terrorism, civil unrest, fire, epidemic, governmental action, or Internet/service interruptions (“Force Majeure”). The affected party shall promptly notify the other and make reasonable efforts to mitigate the impact. If a Force Majeure event continues for more than 30 days, either party may terminate these Terms by written notice.
